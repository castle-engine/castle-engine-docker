# GitHub Actions workflow that updates all Docker images of Castle Game Engine:
#
# - cge-none (prerequisites, like FPC (stable versuib),
#   Android SDK/NDK, texture tools...),
# - cge-none-fpxXXX (same as cge-none but with alternative FPC version,
#   see https://hub.docker.com/r/kambi/castle-engine-cloud-builds-tools/ )
# - cge-stable, cge-unstable
#
# See https://castle-engine.io/docker for more about this Docker image.
